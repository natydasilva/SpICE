Create and plot ICE curves clusters with geographical constrains


### Functions 
- compute derivatives of smoothed curves
- compute clusters, imported from geoClusters
- compute optimum value for alpha and plot results for a gange of clusters (based on geoClusters)
- plot curve clusters
- plot gographical location (map) of curve clusters
- (TODO) linked plot of curves and map
