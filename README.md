`SpICE`: Compute ICE curves clusters with geographical constrains and visualization

The SpICE R package implements the computation and visualisation of SpICE curves. Its combines the individual conditional expectation plot (ICE-plot), a model-agnostic method for interpreting statistical learning models with spatial information. An ICE-plot extension is proposed in which spatial information is used as a restriction to define spatial ICE (SpICE) curves.

### Functions 

- compute derivatives of smoothed curves
- cl_sobocurve compute clusters, imported from geoClusters
- plot_alpha compute optimum value for alpha and plot results for a gange of clusters (based on geoClusters)
- plot_clcurve plot curve clusters
- plot_clcoord plot geographical location (map) of curve clusters
- plot_interactive (TODO) linked plot of curves and map
